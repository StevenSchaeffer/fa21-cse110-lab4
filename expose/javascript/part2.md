1. On line 12, `i` is printed to the console. `3` is printed in this case because there are three elements in the list used for the parameter `prices`.
2. On line 13, `discountedPrice` is printed to the console. `150` is printed in this case because the last discounted price calculated in the loop is equivalent to fifty percent of three hundred.
3. On line 14, `finalPrice` is printed to the console. `150` is printed in this case because the final price calculated in the loop is equivalent to fifty percent of three hundred.
4. The function returns `[ 50, 100, 150 ]`. The discounted price for each index is pushed to `discounted`.
5. A `ReferenceError` is returned because `i` is not defined.
